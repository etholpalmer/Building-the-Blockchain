# Case Study Proposal: [Mogo Finance Technology Inc (Mogo Inc)](https://mogo.ca/)

## What Is It

Mogo Finance Technology Inc was founded in 2003, and operates an online lending platform aimed a millenials with a variety of credit solutions including:

* short term loans
* prepaid credit card
* credit score 'protection'
* small loans
* mortgage
* investments
* bitcoin

Mogo is the 'banking training wheels' for millenials.  The group represents a significant portion of the population who are generally considered to be iconoclasts with respect to where they want to put their money.

Many millennials rely on their checking and savings accounts to help manage their finances, but they're increasingly swapping out traditional brick-and-mortar banks for new banking options. When millennials are dissatisfied with their bank, they're not afraid to move to greener pastures; they're 2.5 times more likely than Baby Boomers and 1.5 times more likely than Gen Xers to switch banks.

Millennials gravitate to 'Neobanks' which usually do not offer a physical branch to access services.  This is how Mogo is designed.  The current marketing is hyperfocused on the millennial market.  For example by tethering spending to planting trees, automating investments by using 'your spare change'.

This group was never 'under banked' they needed more attention to properly navigate the world of finance, this is what Mogo Financial Tech. is for them.

## Why This Matters

"94% of millennials also said that no-fee banking was a priority".  This contradicts the current traditional banking model.  "When millennials are dissatisfied with their bank, they're not afraid to move to greener pastures; they're 2.5 times more likely than Baby Boomers and 1.5 times more likely than Gen Xers to switch banks."  When you take these two facts into consideration it makes sense to develop a separate space for them to do their banking.

Most Neobanks are actually offshoots of traditional banks, Scotia Bank has Tangerine, Simplii is owned by CIBC.  So there is precedence and a clear recognition that business as usual will not work.

The groups needs as a whole has to be catered for and this has sparked a revolution in the banking industry.  

Mogo will help you pay off high-interest debt at a lower rate.  Cards like these are often touted as a financially responsible way to keep a lid on spending by avoiding debt or overdraft charges—particularly for younger people. But as with most prepaid credit cards, there are still fees attached. For instance, Mogo earns money with their prepaid cards by deducting $1.50 from the prepaid funds for ATM cash withdrawal. While there are no monthly fees or loading fees, if you don’t use the card for 91 days, Mogo charges you an inactivity fee of two dollars per month until your balance is zero.
