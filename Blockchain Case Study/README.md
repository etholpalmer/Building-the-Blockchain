# Case Study Proposal: [Mogo Finance Technology Inc (Mogo Inc)](https://mogo.ca/)

## What Is It

Mogo Finance Technology Inc was founded in 2003 and operates an online lending platform aimed a Millenials with a variety of credit solutions, including:

* short term loans
* prepaid credit card
* credit score 'protection.'
* small loans
* mortgage
* investments
* bitcoin

Mogo is the 'banking training wheels' for Millenials.  The group represents a significant portion of the population who are generally considered iconoclasts regarding where they want to put their money.

Many millennials rely on their checking and savings accounts to help manage their finances, but they're increasingly swapping traditional brick-and-mortar banks for new banking options. Moreover, when millennials are dissatisfied with their bank, they're not afraid to move to greener pastures; they're 2.5 times more likely than Baby Boomers and 1.5 times more likely than Gen Xers to switch banks.

Millennials gravitate to 'Neobanks,' which usually do not offer a physical branch to access services.  Mogo is so designed.  The current marketing is hyperfocused on the millennial market, for example, by tethering spending to planting trees, automating investments by using your spare change.

This group was never 'underbanked.' However, they needed more attention to navigating the world of finance properly; this is what Mogo Financial Tech. is for them.

The investment complements Mogo's broader cryptocurrency strategy, including its recent investment in Canada's leading digital asset platform, Coinsquare. In addition, the Company announced that it had purchased approximately 146 Ether (ETH) at an average price of US$2,780. Ethereum is an open-source, blockchain-based, decentralized software platform that uses its cryptocurrency, Ether.

## Why This Matters

"94% of millennials also said that no-fee banking was a priority".  This contradicts the current traditional banking model.  "When millennials are dissatisfied with their bank, they're not afraid to move to greener pastures; they're 2.5 times more likely than Baby Boomers and 1.5 times more likely than Gen Xers to switch banks."  When you consider these two facts, it makes sense to develop a separate space for them to do their banking.

Most Neobanks are offshoots of traditional banks; Scotia Bank has Tangerine, CIBC owns Simplii.  So there is a precedence and a clear recognition that business as usual will not work.  The group's needs have to be catered for, which has sparked a revolution in the banking industry.  

Mogo's Ethereum investment is consistent with management's plans to increase the Company's balance sheet investment in the blockchain and fintech ecosystem, particularly as it monetizes its portfolio of equity investments that had a value of approximately $18.4 million on December 31, 2020. Last week, Mogo announced the sale of its investment in Vena Solutions for proceeds of $4.7 million, a 116% increase from the book value on December 31, 2020. In addition, the Company has already invested in Bitcoin, acquiring approximately 18 Bitcoins to date in open market transactions at an average price of US$33,083. Mogo plans to invest up to 5% of its cash and investment portfolio value in cryptocurrencies.

## Why This May be Interesting

Mogo Completes Acquisition of Canadian Investment Dealer Fortification Capital Inc. - to be Renamed MogoTrade.  Mogo acquires the necessary licenses, registration and technology – including an order management system and market data processing – to accelerate the development of MogoTrade, the Company's commission-free stock trading solution.

The banks of the second opportunity are generally what millennials need. Many of them need credit repair services and a second chance that's not perceived as forthcoming from the major banks. Mogo will loan you money even with bad credit.  Technically they operate more like the traditional payday loan with their products like 'MogoMini' and 'MogoZip.'  'As a word of caution, those with bad credit need to be particularly careful when taking out a payday loan with MogoMini or MogoZip. Short-term, high-interest loans like MogoZip often cost a sizable chunk in interest charges on top of paying back the loan'.

Mogo has been on an acquisition spree in the fintech and cryptocurrency spaces and has recently bought companies including Fortification Capital, Carta Solutions, and Moka Financial.
